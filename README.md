# twitter_analytics
Web-based project to provide a platform for viewing tweets, trends and other user information.
Site is not live. Can be run on localhost with: `python3 manage.py runserver`
User needs to add twitter API credentials in `twittermap/views.py`.

### Results/Progress
Currently allows user to search for two unique twitter users and displays different stats about them. 

Looking to incorporate trends, social network visualization of some sort, and deeper analysis tools.
